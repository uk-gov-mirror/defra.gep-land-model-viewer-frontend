## Requirements

### Node.js

Please install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) `>= v24` and [npm](https://nodejs.org/) `>= v10`. You will find it
easier to use the Node Version Manager [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)

To use the correct version of Node.js for this application, via nvm:

```bash
cd gep-land-model-viewer-frontend
nvm use
```

## Server-side Caching

We use Catbox for server-side caching. By default the service will use CatboxRedis when deployed and CatboxMemory for
local development.
You can override the default behaviour by setting the `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE` environment variable to either `redis` or
`memory`.

Please note: CatboxMemory (`memory`) is _not_ suitable for production use! The cache will not be shared between each
instance of the service and it will not persist between restarts.

## Redis

Redis is an in-memory key-value store. Every instance of a service has access to the same Redis key-value store similar
to how services might have a database (or MongoDB). All frontend services are given access to a namespaced prefixed that
matches the service name. e.g. `my-service` will have access to everything in Redis that is prefixed with `my-service`.

If your service does not require a session cache to be shared between instances or if you don't require Redis, you can
disable setting `SESSION_CACHE_ENGINE=false` or changing the default value in `src/config/index.js`.

## Proxy

We are using forward-proxy which is set up by default. To make use of this: `import { fetch } from 'undici'` then
because of the `setGlobalDispatcher(new ProxyAgent(proxyUrl))` calls will use the ProxyAgent Dispatcher

If you are not using Wreck, Axios or Undici or a similar http that uses `Request`. Then you may have to provide the
proxy dispatcher:

To add the dispatcher to your own client:

```javascript
import { ProxyAgent } from 'undici'

return await fetch(url, {
  dispatcher: new ProxyAgent({
    uri: proxyUrl,
    keepAliveTimeout: 10,
    keepAliveMaxTimeout: 10
  })
})
```

## Local Development

### Setup

Install application dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

To run the application in `development` mode run:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production

To mimic the application running in `production` mode locally run:

```bash
npm start
```

### Npm scripts

All available Npm scripts can be seen in [package.json](./package.json)
To view them in your command line run:

```bash
npm run
```

### Update dependencies

To update dependencies use [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates):

> The following script is a good start. Check out all the options on
> the [npm-check-updates](https://github.com/raineorshine/npm-check-updates)

```bash
ncu --interactive --format group
```

### Linting and Formatting

Code style and formatting are enforced by [neostandard](https://github.com/neostandard/neostandard) via ESLint, per the [Defra JavaScript coding standards](https://defra.github.io/software-development-standards/). SCSS is linted by StyleLint with the GDS config.

```bash
npm run lint          # Check for issues (read-only)
npm run format        # Auto-fix issues
```

If you are having issues with line break formatting on Windows, update your global git config:

```bash
git config --global core.autocrlf false
```

### Testing

Run the test suite with coverage:

```bash
npm test
```

To run a single test file:

```bash
npx vitest run path/to/file.test.js
```

Test coverage must meet 90% for lines, functions, statements and branches. This is enforced by the [vitest configuration](vitest.config.js).

### CI/CD

Pull requests to `develop` and `main` trigger the [Check Pull Request](.github/workflows/check-pull-request.yml) workflow which ensures the frontend builds, linting passes, tests run with coverage thresholds met, a security audit passes, and the Docker image builds successfully.

A [Gitflow PR target check](.github/workflows/gitflow-pr-target-check.yml) runs on all pull requests to ensure branches are targeting the correct base branch.

#### Build and deploy

Merges to `develop` trigger [Publish Develop](.github/workflows/publish-develop.yml) which patch-bumps a git tag (e.g. `0.3.1`, `0.3.2`) and builds a Docker image with that version. CDP auto-deploys these to the dev environment.

Pushes to a `release/*` branch trigger [Publish Release](.github/workflows/publish-release.yml) which builds a versioned Docker image (e.g. `0.2.0`), creates a git tag, updates `package.json`, and opens a draft PR to `main` with auto-generated release notes. Release branches must be named `release/X.Y` (e.g. `release/0.2`). The branch represents the minor version line - the workflow starts at `X.Y.0` and auto-increments the patch on each push. Deploy the release artifact to staging and production via the CDP portal, then mark the PR ready for review and merge once tested.

When a PR is merged into `main`, the [Auto Back-merge](.github/workflows/auto-back-merge.yml) workflow opens a PR to merge `main` back into `develop`. Review and merge it to keep develop up to date.

Hotfixes are handled by the [Publish Hot Fix](.github/workflows/publish-hotfix.yml) workflow, triggered manually from a hotfix branch. Each trigger builds a new patch version (e.g. `0.2.1`, `0.2.2`) so fixes can be re-tested before merging. Deploy hotfix artifacts via the CDP portal.

## Docker

### Development image

> [!TIP]
> For Apple Silicon users, you may need to add `--platform linux/amd64` to the `docker run` command to ensure
> compatibility fEx: `docker build --platform=linux/arm64 --no-cache --tag gep-land-model-viewer-frontend`

Build:

```bash
docker build --target development --no-cache --tag gep-land-model-viewer-frontend:development .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 gep-land-model-viewer-frontend:development
```

### Production image

Build:

```bash
docker build --no-cache --tag gep-land-model-viewer-frontend .
```

Run:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 gep-land-model-viewer-frontend
```

### Docker Compose

A local environment with:

- Localstack for AWS services (S3, SQS)
- Redis
- MongoDB
- This service.
- A commented out backend example.

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

### Dependabot

Dependabot is configured in [.github/dependabot.yml](.github/dependabot.yml) to automatically create pull requests for dependency updates weekly.

### SonarCloud

SonarCloud runs static analysis on pull requests via the [Check Pull Request](.github/workflows/check-pull-request.yml) workflow. Configuration is in [sonar-project.properties](./sonar-project.properties). Results are available on the [SonarCloud dashboard](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=DEFRA_gep-land-model-viewer-frontend).

## Branching Strategy

This project follows [Gitflow](https://defra.github.io/software-development-standards/guides/developer_workflows/#gitflow) with `develop` as the integration branch and `main` for production releases. Releases and hotfixes merge into `main` only - the [Auto Back-merge](.github/workflows/auto-back-merge.yml) workflow handles syncing `main` back into `develop` automatically. See [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md#branching) for full details.
